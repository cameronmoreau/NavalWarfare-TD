# NavalWarfare-TD
TD game made for US History

So I got out of writing a 1,000 word essay by creating a game for US History.  It's no BattleField and yeah it probably took **WAY** more time, but I'd still rather code than stare deeply into Microsoft Word until I can think of a few words to write down.

### Some background
The asignment here was to write a 1,000+ word essay over a primary source that hasn't really ever been written about. After browsing archives of newspaper articles, wondering how I could ever make a game about this. Finally, I came across an interesting news report from a British Admiral, about how he went super clutch mode and wrecked a bunch of German ships during WWI (I later found that this was the battle of Jutland).

### The game
The year is 1916 and you play as [British Vice-Admiral, David Beatty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beatty,_1st_Earl_Beatty). Your job is to command your fleet just like he did, in the small naval conflict of 1916. As the clock ticks, more and more Germany ships try and reach you, so you must setup your fleet and small artillery units along the side islands. Earn British Pounds by sinking the Germans and use that money to build more units.

### Some Sources
Here's a few awesome websites that helped me learn about the types of military units the British and Germans used during WWI
